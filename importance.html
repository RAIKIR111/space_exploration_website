                        <p class="text__importance">Since ancient time people have been trying to learn space using telescopes and other facilities. At first, these people were not taken very seriously and almost everyone thought that they were crazy. It is very hard to believe but without spaceships, satellites and other research devices these talented persons made a plenty of discoveries. Afterwards their scientific achievements were used for subsequent space discoveries. <br/> For example in Russian schools we hardly study any space exploration history at all and its perception among my fellows is vague. We also do not encounter the theme of space technologies even in IT technologies subject. Of course, we need to study Pascal or Python (programming languages for beginners) but sometimes we should work with space exploration history and technologies at least. We need to know that history because it is vital for producing the further knowledge. I am sure there are teenagers that have a substantial potential of working in this area. Therefore we need a program integrating space studies into the curriculum. <br/> So, this website will help you to learn the space exploration history.</p>
